model file -- load model
app.py (streamlit stuff) -- load model on streamlit and do .predict

make streamlit




nice to have:
data.py (collects and cleans data) - maybe split into data_cloud and data_local
preproc.py (for the model we use) - if we use more than one model, then different
funcs for each model
model.py (initialise, compile, fit)





super nice to have:
registry to save/load models
params
